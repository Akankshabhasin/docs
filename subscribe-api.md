The Subscribe API allows you to connect to a conversation or a meeting in listen-only mode. 

Using this API, you can allow users to subscribe to webinars or conferences where there are only a handful of speakers and most participants are only listening in. 

While users connected on websocket are charged per user, the listen-only participants can stream the transcription and insight services at no cost. 

This can be turned on or off for a conversation, on demand. 

### API Endpoint

`wss://api.symbl.ai/v1/subscribe/{connectionId}?access_token={accessToken}`

This is a WebSocket endpoint that lets you subscribe to all the real-time updates. Often, this URL is auto-generated by services such as the inbound-stream-integeration.


Parameter | Required  | Value
--------- | ---------- | ------ 
`connectionId` | Mandatory | The same `connectionId` that is generated with the Streaming API can be used to subscribe to this API.  
`accessToken` | Mandatory | The Symbl's Authentication token you get from the [Authentication process](/docs/developer-tools/authentication/).
