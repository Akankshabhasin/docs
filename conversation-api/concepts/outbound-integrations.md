The platform currently offers email as out-of-box integration with the Node.js SDK and calendar integration on the pre-built post conversation summary UI. However, this can be extended to any work tool using extensible webhooks, where the actionable insights need to be pushed to enhance productivity and reduce the time taken by users to manually enter information from conversations. The same integrations can be enabled as suggestive actions to make this even quicker.

Some of the examples of these work tools that can be integrated using the extensible webhooks can be:

* Sales platforms such as Salesforce, Copper
* Task management solutions such as Trello, Google Tasks
* Calendars
* Project Management Tools such as Monday, Asana
* Collaboration platforms such as Slack, Flock
