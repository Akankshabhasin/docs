This feature is in the Beta phase. If you have any questions, ideas or suggestions please reach out to us atÂ devrelations@symbl.ai.

You can use the GET Tracker API in two ways:
- [GET Tracker by ID](#get-tracker-by-id)
- [GET Tracker by query params](#get-tracker)

## GET Tracker by ID
This API gets the Tracker entity against the `trackerId` provided which can then be consumed in Symbl APIs. 

:::info Currently, this Tracker entity can be consumed in the [Async APIs](/docs/async-api/introduction) only. Support for the other APIs will be added soon.
