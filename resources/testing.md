Now that you've built out an integration using either the Voice SDK or Voice API, let's test to make sure your integration is working as expected.

1. If you are dialed in with your phone number, try speaking the following sentences to see the generated output

* "Hey, it was nice meeting you yesterday. Let's catch up again next week over coffee sometime in the evening. I would love to discuss the next steps in our strategic roadmap with you."

* "I will set up a meeting with Roger to discuss our budget plan for the next quarter and then plan out how much we can set aside for marketing efforts. I also need to sit down with Jess to talk about the status of the current project. I'll set up a meeting with her probably tomorrow before our standup."

2. If you are dialed into a meeting, try running any of the following videos with your meeting platform open and view the summary email that gets generated:

* <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKorP55Aqvg" target="_blank"> Scrum Meeting </a>
* <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8Kt7fRa2Wc" target="_blank"> Progress Meeting </a>

3. Try tuning your summary page with query parameters to customize your output.
